# US Census Data Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the US Census data, focusing on factors such as Age Group, State, and Gender. The data used in this analysis was obtained from the official US Census website and cleaned for further processing. This GitHub repository also includes the data files used in the analysis.

## Report Summary

The analysis in this report consists of two primary sections:

1. **Analysis 1: Change in Population from 2010 to 2020**
   - This analysis examines the population changes in different states between 2010 and 2020, categorizing them into four regions: Northeast, Midwest, West, and South. The report presents the percentage difference in population during this period and colour codes the states based on their population change.

2. **Analysis 2: Change in Population by Age Group, Year, and Gender**
   - This analysis explores the population changes across different age groups, years (2010 and 2020), genders (male and female), and states. The report presents a grouped stacked bar chart with colour coding based on gender.

The report highlights key findings and inferences from the data, providing insights into population trends across different regions, age groups, and genders. It also suggests areas for further exploration and validating hypotheses using underlying data and analysis.

## Key Inferences

### Analysis 1: Population Change from 2010 to 2020

- Northeast and Midwest regions experienced population growth of less than 2% or even negative growth, possibly due to an ageing population, outward migration, slower economic growth, and fewer job opportunities.
- West and South regions observed population growth of over 8%, attributed to factors such as job opportunities, lower cost of living, Sunbelt migration,' and higher birth rates.
- Further analysis is recommended to investigate the reasons behind the observed population trends.

### Analysis 2: Population Change by Age Group, Year, and Gender

- Gender distribution across age groups showed a marginal male population advantage for children and Generation Z (ages 0-24). Millennials and Generation X (ages 25-56) exhibited similar male and female proportions. For Baby Boomers and the Silent Generation (ages 57 and above), the female population significantly exceeded the male population.
- Population changes varied across age groups, with children and Generation X experiencing a decrease, while the other four age groups observed population growth. Baby Boomers had the highest increase in population, followed by Millennials, the Silent Generation, and Generation Z.
- The dominant age groups were Generation X, Generation Z, and Millennials, with similar population sizes.
- Future analysis could explore organic population growth based on births and deaths and the impact of immigration on the US population across different age groups.

## Conclusion

This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of the US Census data, focusing on population changes based on age group, state, and gender. The findings indicate varying population trends across regions, ages, and genders, influenced by the ageing population, migration patterns, economic growth, job opportunities, cost of living, and birth rates. The report also highlights areas for further exploration and suggests validating hypotheses using underlying data and analysis techniques.

The data used in this analysis was obtained from the official US Census website (https://data.census.gov/). 

The data files used in the analysis are included in this GitHub repository for reference and reproducibility.
